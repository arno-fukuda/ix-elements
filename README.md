# Elements

Elements are written to make it easy to work in a variety of web frameworks. If there isn't a framework-specific element, you can use the [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) version that can be used by most modern web frameworks and web application environments.
